## Contributing guidance

**All PRs should be made to the `develop` branch, not `master`.**

Before going ahead with customizing components and creating new features, please have in mind that you should

**Never edit original core Vulcanjs packages!** You should only change what's inside the Moonly package.

Check [this part](http://docs.vulcanjs.org/example-customization.html) of documentation to see how to customize existing and create new features.
